VERSION 1.4.1

	- Fixed switching of applications across monitors
	- Changed window flashing API (fix your config files)
	- Added NetworkMonitorWidget (thanks to weiwen)

VERSION 1.4.0

	- Added a SeparatorWidget.
	- Implemented some xmonad-like functionality for multiple-monitors -
	  see SwapCurrentWorkspaceWith, SwitchToNextMonitor and
	  SwitchToPreviousMonitor. Thanks to mkocubinski for the idea and
	  some of the implementation.
	- Implemented AddBarToWorkspace and RemoveBarFromWorkspace.
	- Small performance improvements.

VERSION 1.3.2

	- Fixed some annoying bugs when using multiple monitors.
	- Fixed an issue when restoring a minimized window.
	- Added InputLanguageChangerPlugin - see the usage file for information.
	- Added RamMonitorWidget (thanks to vOSHoHpC for the code) -
	  see the usage file for information

VERSION 1.3.1

	Some performance improvements for Windows Vista+ users.
	Any issues/recommendations/requests for future versions?

VERSION 1.3.0

	Bug fixes and performance improvements. Most importantly:

	- Fixed the LanguageBarWidget which didn't work under XP
	  (thanks to daedric for the bug-report)
	- Windawesome will set itself to have a High priority.
	  This should make it much more responsive
	  (if you hadn't done that already)

VERSION 1.2.6

	Some small fixes, mainly connected with Windows 7, where strange things
	happen if you use a slideshow for the desktop background image. There is
	a slight change in the config files - UniqueHotkey is not used anymore
	so you should remove it.

VERSION 1.2.5

	Bug-fix release. Small performance improvements too. The only visible change
	would be the fact that the config option "updateIcon" is now "false" by
	default - i.e. you have to explicitly tell which windows you would like to
	update their icons in the Application Tabs Widget (the only such one I
	personally use is the Windows Explorer).

VERSION 1.2.4

	Again minor fixes here and there. A couple of notable changes:

	- I think I've finally got the hang of owned windows. Everything
	  should work as expected... I hope. :)
	- I've added an auto update feature. That is, it only checks for
	  new versions and will tell you if there is one. It checks an XML
	  file for the latest version which is hosted in Dropbox.
	- I've refactored some helper functions to a different class which means
	  that shortcuts need to be updated. Take a look at my config files to
	  see what you must change.

VERSION 1.2.3

	This version contains small fixes and performance improvements.
	Notable changes:

	- I've added a new tip in the documentation which is about setting
	  the Windawesome process to be at the highest possible priority
	  (which should make it a bit faster and not swap it to disk all the time).
	  I noticed that Windawesome ran at "Below Normal" priority when it was
	  started by the Task Scheduler at logon.
	- Windawesome should be able to correctly handle Windows shutting down,
	  i.e. you don't have to quit it in order to shut down the machine.

VERSION 1.2.2

	Yet more fixes for topmost-window handling and window activation
	(this proved to be more error-prone and more difficult to implement
	efficiently than expected). Added the
	onWindowCreatedOnInactiveWorkspaceAction ProgramRule and renamed a
	bunch of others so you should fix your custom configs.

VERSION 1.2.1

	I've fixed some problems and improved some things connected with finding the
	topmost window and window activation. Be sure to read the changes from the
	previous version too.

VERSION 1.2.0

	A lot of changes are incorporated in this release. There are many changes to
	the config files too, so update yours as necessary. Most notable changes:

	- Removed lots of code which countered Windows' sporadic activation of windows
	  and therefore disrupting the Z-order I have made. This will mostly show up
	  on multiple-monitor solutions and only if you use ALT-TAB. For that reason,
	  now you should mostly use ALT-J/ALT-K - it's more convenient anyway. :)
	- Added updateIcon to ProgramRules.
	  Read the usage file to find out what it does.
	- Many small changes that should improve general stability and speed.


VERSION 1.1.3

	Fixed a value which caused a crash for the x86 version.
	This is an important change for x64 too.

VERSION 1.1.2

	Fixed some problems which arose from the changes in the previous version,
	particularly with owned-window management.

VERSION 1.1.1

	This version contains mainly small bug fixes.

VERSION 1.1.0

	- Added the LanguageBarWidget, which is pretty useless if you use only one
	  input language in your Windows, but everybody else might like it.
	- Fixed some hangings because of functions which are not supposed to hang,
	  at least according to Microsoft.
	- Changed a bit the code which activates applications... hopefully there will
	  be MUCH (like 90+%) less blinking windows.
	- Sometimes window activation wasn't being registered.
	  That should be fixed now.

VERSION 1.0.20

	This version contains some bug fixes, as well as a couple of new features:
	- Added better handling of owned windows. Basic idea is that whenever a
	  window is managed by Windawesome, its owned will be hidden/shown with it.
	  See MSDN if you are unsure what an owned window is and the usage.txt for a
	  little bit more info.
	- Added another window "order" apart from the Z order. It is the same as the
	  tab-order which the ApplicationTabsWidget shows. The default hotkeys for
	  moving through windows are ALT J/K and for moving the windows to different
	  positions in the order are SHIFT ALT J/K. Note that Z-order is still used
	  when showing windows on changing workspaces, however I am doing horrible
	  hacks for that, as I have to counter Windows' sporadic behavior of
	  activating windows randomly. Therefore, I am thinking of removing that in
	  the future. Shout if you think it's a bad idea. :)
	- A lot of changes to the config files so take a look.

VERSION 1.0.19

	This version contains only bug fixes.

VERSION 1.0.18

	This version contains many bug fixes and improvements.
	Notable additions:

	- hideFromAltTabAndTaskbarWhenOnInactiveWorkspace option for the Rule class.
	- Added a LaptopBatteryMonitorWidget.

Be sure to merge the new config files with yours as there are important changes.

VERSION 1.0.17

	This version is the first to support multiple monitors.
	The main ideas:

	- Every monitor should have at least one workspace at all times.
	- Bars are per-monitor. Workspaces can have different bars on
	  different monitors. When you create a Workspace with a list of Bars,
	  each will be displayed only on its corresponding monitor (e.g. Bars 1
	  and 2 are on monitor A and Bar 3 is on monitor B, then if you construct
	  a workspace with the list (3, 1) for Bars, then bar 1 will be displayed
	  when the workspace is on monitor A, and bar 3 will be displayed when
	  the workspace is on monitor B).
	- The default config files do not include the ability to move workspaces
	  around monitors. You can use the function MoveWorkspaceToMonitor
	  in Windawesome for that.
	- In this version you should make sure you do not have a window on two or
	  more workspaces which are visible on two or more monitors at the same time.

Various other fixes included in the release. There are many changes to the config files so make sure you update yours as needed.


VERSION 1.0.16

	This is a bug-fix release mainly. Notable changes are:

	- Widgets can now refresh when RefreshWindawesome is called
	  (ALT - SHIFT - "R" by default) - this is mainly for the
	  System Tray Widget which sometimes doesn't work properly.
	- Added the ability to remove menu bars from windows. You have to
	  make your own shortcut for toggling the menu (use the
	  ToggleShowHideWindowMenu function) or use the ProgramRule to
	  specify whether to initially show the menu or not. Note that this
	  doesn't work for a lot of applications actually as they don't use
	  Windows' concept for menus.
	- Some changes in the APIs and naming - make sure to update your
	  config files as needed.

VERSION 1.0.15

	Huge number of improvements that should fix a host of problems.
	Note the change, again, in the API for creating Workspaces -
	make sure to update your config files as needed.

VERSION 1.0.14

	Added the customMatchingFunction option for the ProgramRules.

	Made the LoggerPlugin output more information on program rule
	matching so if you have problems with windows (not) being managed,
	try using that.

	Windows are now shown synchronously, which could cause delays if
	there is a hung window, but otherwise should work faster, better,
	preserve the Z-order correctly and reduce flickering immensely.

	Various fixes here and there.

VERSION 1.0.13

	Added hideOwnedPopups, redrawDesktopOnWindowCreated, tryAgainAfter,
	showOnWorkspacesCount, onHiddenWindowShownAction and onWindowCreatedAction
	to the rules. Read the USAGE file for explanation.

	Various fixes and improvements.

VERSION 1.0.12

	Added a couple of options for the ProgramRule and Rule
	(processName, activateLastActivePopup) - read in the Usage
	file what exactly are they for.

	One more go at the problem with the resetting of the Windows
	working area when certain things happen. Now, theoretically,
	when Remote Desktoping to a machine, Windawesome should handle
	the change fine. However, Windows is inconsistent in sending
	messages so expect bad behavior sometimes.

	I've added a couple of useful hotkeys - you might want to
	take a look at those.

	Note the change in the API for the creation of the Workspaces so
	if you have custom config files make sure you update them properly.

VERSION 1.0.11

	Windawesome should no longer have a problem when another program
	is docked to the end of the screen or when the resolution of the
	monitor is changed, i.e. Windawesome should re-size the bars and
	widgets and should reposition all windows. Note, however, that
	both at the same time do not work - read the "Known bugs/limitations"
	in Usage.txt for more information.

VERSION 1.0.10

	Fixed some small issues. Minor improvements in a bunch of places.

	Note the changes in the config files since the last version -
	if you have custom configurations, there will be things to fix.

	Take a look at the tips section in Usage.txt - I've added a way to
	stop Windows from focusing a program's menu when you press Alt,
	which is extremely helpful if you use Alt + number to switch
	between workspaces as I do.

VERSION 1.0.9

	Fixed a couple of small bugs that could cause a crash in
	Windawesome.

	Other minor improvements.

VERSION 1.0.8

	This version only contains a new version of the System Tray
	widget which was revised to work like before - it seems
	that this is the only way I can make it work all the time.

VERSION 1.0.7

	Fixed a small bug that sometimes caused windows to
	disappear on startup.

	Changed the way Windawesome activates windows, when
	switching workspaces for example. It should now work better,
	faster and it won't hung the WM when there is a hung application.
	Note the new option (uniqueHotkey). Now, even more than before,
	it is best to run Windawesome elevated. Take a look at the
	tips section in the Usage.txt readme to see how to do that
	without the UIC prompt.

VERSION 1.0.6

	Added a new (handleOwnedWindows) option in the
	ProgramRules which allows Windawesome to handle owned
	windows. This should fix all problems with applications
	written in VCL.

VERSION 1.0.5

	Since last version, Windawesome is compiled with
	VS 2010 SP1's compilers.

	Upgraded the IronPython/IronRuby DLLs and their usage
	to the newest versions. This gives a HUGE performance
	boost in start up time over the previous version.

	Windawesome should now recognize windows written with
	the VCL framework better.

	Minor bug fixes and improvements in lots of places.

VERSION 1.0.4

	Now uses asynchronous show/hide functions in most places
	which should help when a window is hung.

	Added new options to redraw a window when shown and to
	reposition the windows in a workspace when switched to.

	Modified the System Tray Widget to work a bit differently
	(better). Hopefully there won't be problems.

	Improved the way icons are got from applications.
	Should not block the UI.

VERSION 1.0.3

	Exported the keyboard hook as a plugin. It should now work
	better and not crash at all. Read the Usage.txt for details.

	In Vista now the start menu button should hide.

VERSION 1.0.2

	Fixed a couple of small issues and made some improvements.

VERSION 1.0.1

	Added styles to the program rules. Reordered the way icons
	are being found for applications.

VERSION 1.0.0

	Initial release
