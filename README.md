Windawesome (pronounced - contrary to what you would expect from the way it is written - Windows-om, not Wind-awesome) is a highly customizable tiling/dynamic window manager with multi-monitor support for Windows, which works on top of explorer.exe and *not* as a shell replacement. It is heavily inspired by [bug.n](http://www.autohotkey.net/~joten/bug.n.html), but tries to go further. Windawesome is (mostly) written in C# and is scriptable and pluggable in IronRuby, IronPython and any .NET language that compiles down to an assembly. Requires .NET Framework 4 Client Profile, Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable and IronRuby/IronPython DLLs. The main bundle comes with 3 configuration files (2 in Python, 1 in Ruby), 3 layouts (2 built-in and one as a C# DLL), a couple of Plugins and many Widgets, one of which is written in Ruby. Works with 32- and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 8.1. Goes under the GNU General Public License version 2.
